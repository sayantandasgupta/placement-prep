     * Problem Statement :

        Today you decided to go to the gym. You currently have energy equal to E units. There are N exercises in the gym. Each of these exercises drains Ai amount of energy from your body.

        You feel tired if your energy reaches 0 or below. Calculate the minimum number of exercises you have to perform such that you become tired. Every unique exercise can only be performed at most 2 times as others also have to use the machines.

        If performing all the exercises does not make you feel tired, return -1.

        Input Format
        E :: INTEGER
        The first line contains an integer, E, denoting the Energy.
        E :: 1 -> 10^5

        N :: INTEGER
        The next line contains an integer, N, denoting the number of exercises. N :: 1 -> 10^5

        A :: INTEGER ARRAY
        Each line i of the N subsequent lines (where 0 â‰¤ i < N) contains an integer describing the amount of energy drained by i-th exercise.
        A[i] :: 1 -> 10^5

        Sample Input 1:
            6
            2
            1
            2

        Sample Output 1 :
            4

        Sample input 2:
            10
            2
            1
            2

        Sample Output 2:
            -1

            3
            1

            2

        Sample Output 3:
            1
