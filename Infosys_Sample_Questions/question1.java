    /*
     * Today you decided to go to the gym. You currently have energy equal to E units. There are N exercises in
        the gym. Each of these exercises drains Ai amount of energy from your body.
        You feel tired if your energy reaches 0 or below. Calculate the minimum number of exercises you have
        to perform such that you become tired. Every unique exercise can only be performed at most 2 times as
        others also have to use the machines.
        If performing all the exercises does not make you feel tired, return -1.

        Parameters:

            E :: INTEGER
            The first line contains an integer, E, denoting the Energy.
            E :: 1 -> 10^5
            N :: INTEGER
            The next line contains an integer, N, denoting the number of exercises.
            N :: 1 -> 10^5
            A :: INTEGER ARRAY
            Each line i of the N subsequent lines (where 0 â‰¤ i < N) contains an integer describing the amount of
            energy drained by i-th exercise.
            A[i] :: 1 -> 10^5

        Test Cases
        Case#: 1
            Input:
                6
                2
                1
                2
            Output:
                4
                E = 6
                Do 1st exercise 2 times
                Do 2nd exercise 2 times
                Hence, total exercises done 4.
